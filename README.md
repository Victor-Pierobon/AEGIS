I'm developing A.E.G.I.S. - a Python-based AI assistant with these features:

Voice input/output using SpeechRecognition/pyttsx3

Tkinter/ttkbootstrap GUI interface

DeepSeek API integration

Code editor with syntax highlighting

Secure .env configuration

Current version has working voice/text input and API integration but needs:
[ ] Wake word detection implementation
[ ] Better error handling for voice recognition
[ ] GUI performance optimizations
[ ] Code analysis feature expansion
[ ] Cross-platform compatibility improvements

Please help me implement these features while maintaining:

Clean code architecture

Cyberpunk aesthetic (purple/dark theme)

Responsive interface

Secure API key handling
